# Nephele Go Style Guide

This style guide outlines the coding conventions of Nephele team.

# Background

Nephele is a complete solution to enterprise multimedia needs. Go is one of the main development language used by most of Nephele team members. The very go language is simple, powerful and probably a most officially restricted language, yet still used in a relatively smaller range. Thus in some common cases, we still lack rules and conventions intended to prevent obstacles of team efficiency and barriers to learning.
